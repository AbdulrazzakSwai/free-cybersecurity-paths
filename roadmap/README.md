## How This Roadmap Works

- The roadmap is divided into **levels** based on your current knowledge and skill set.
- Each level covers key concepts, hands-on skills, and practical exercises.
- Follow the levels in order for the best learning experience.
- All resources are free and focused on **both learning and hands-on practice**.

## Roadmap Levels Overview

### Level 1: Foundations  
Learn the basics of IT, including computer hardware and software, operating systems (Windows and Linux), virtualization, networking fundamentals, and Active Directory (AD).

### Level 2: Core Security Skills  
Grasp the fundamentals of cybersecurity, including the CIA triad, how different security domains operate, common threats and attacks, basics of cryptography, access control mechanisms, and key security frameworks.

### Level 3: Offensive & Defensive Security  
Choose your path with focused skills in either offensive (red team) or defensive (blue team) cybersecurity.

**Offensive path** includes topics like hacking methodology and the stages of hacking, network hacking, Active Directory exploitation, web application attacks, wireless attacks, and professional report writing.

**Defensive path** includes topics such as security operations fundamentals, phishing analysis, network security, endpoint protection, SIEM, cyber threat intelligence (CTI), and digital forensics and incident response (DFIR).

### Level 4: Certifications & Specializations  
Explore advanced topics and prepare for hands-on certifications.  
While most certifications are paid, I've selected **affordable, high-value, and fully practical options** that are well-suited for self-learners.
